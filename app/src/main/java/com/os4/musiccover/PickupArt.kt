 * The card's artwork: ColorOS's own 103 files (`applogo/`, `stickers/`, `base_bg_*.webp`,
 * `aod_static_*.webp`), shipped in the apk under `assets/coloros/pickupcode/`.
 *
 * They were fetched from a release for a while, and it worked - with a GitHub proxy in front,
 * because the direct URL from this network dies mid-download. That is a lot of machinery between
 * a user and a picture, and the pictures are 6.6MB that every device needs anyway: bundling costs
 * the apk 6.6MB once and costs the user nothing, which is the better trade for a card whose left
 * half is a picture.
 *
 * Every file is optional. A brand with no picture draws the card without it - the code is what
 * the island is for, and it is drawn from the layout, not from the artwork.
