/**
 * Where the lyric rows come from.
 *
 * Deliberately not a lyric module's API. The modules that do this on this device reach the
 * players by hooking them - and on this device all three of the players were broken at once by
 * app updates the module had not caught up with: a NoSuchFieldError on Apple Music, a
 * NoSuchClassError on Salt, a DexKit cache miss on NetEase. Nothing that inherits that is worth
 * building on.
 *
 * This route never touches the player. A song id comes out of the media session, and the AMLL
 * database - a community-built set of word-level TTML files, one per song, named by the
 * platform's own id - is asked for that id directly. Nothing here breaks when a player updates,
 * because nothing here knows a player's internals.
 *
 * What it does inherit is coverage and the network. Tens of thousands of songs against millions
 * of songs means a miss is normal, and the mirrors are GitHub-hosted, which from here is a coin
 * toss: measured on this device the authoritative copy has answered in 610ms and has also timed
 * out after 23s. Both are handled by being explicit rather than optimistic - a miss leaves the
 * lock screen without lyrics, which is what it had before this existed, and no request is given
 * long enough to be felt.

     * Every key the session is publishing, with enough of each value to recognise it.

     * Which players this feature covers is decided entirely by what they put on the session, and
     * that cannot be reasoned about - only read. Players differ in whether they publish lyrics at
     * all, under `lyricInfo` or a key of their own, whether MEDIA_ID is the platform's id or an
     * internal uri, and whether the title is the song or (for one local player) the current lyric
     * line. So this lists the keys rather than looking for the ones already known: a key nobody
     * here has heard of is exactly what widening the coverage needs to find.
     *
     * Values are cut short and bitmaps are reduced to their size, because a lyric payload is tens
     * of kilobytes and the point is to see WHICH keys carry something, not to read the words.
