/**
 * The catalogues asked after NetEase has nothing - KuGou first, then LrcLib.
 *
 * NcmLyrics covers a song NetEase has and can be made to admit to. Two different things stop it,
 * and neither is rare. The catalogue itself is the first: NetEase is the whole Chinese
 * catalogue and a thin slice of everything else, so a western release routinely is not there at
 * all. Its search is the second, and the worse one - measured repeatedly on this device, being
 * searched too often is answered not with an error but with a page of plausible wrong songs,
 * and a song hidden that way looks exactly like a song that does not exist. NcmLyrics spends a
 * request proving which it is (see searchIsHonest) but it cannot make the answer appear.
 *
 * So the answer to both is another catalogue. These two were picked for what they add rather
 * than for more of the same:
 *
 *   KuGou    - the other whole Chinese catalogue, and the only free one that hands over WORD
 *              timings: its KRC files time every syllable, and carry the translation in the
 *              same file. Three requests and a decryption; see krc().
 *   LrcLib   - a community line-level catalogue, and the one that has the western releases the
 *              other two do not. Its /api/get is an exact matcher rather than a search, which
 *              is the shape this file wants: it either has the recording or says so.
 *
 * Both are plain GETs with no key, no signature and no account, the same as NetEase's. Neither
 * needs anything installed on the phone, which is the whole point of this route: the lyric
 * provider modules cover more players than we ever will, and every one of them is another APK
 * the owner of the phone has to find, install, enable and scope.
 *
 * Order is by what an answer is worth, not by catalogue: word timings beat line timings, so
 * KuGou is asked first and LrcLib answers for what it does not have. Both are asked only after
 * NetEase and the AMLL database have come up empty, so a song that already works costs nothing.
 *
 * The matching is NcmLyrics' - its norm(), its name scoring, its duration windows. That is
 * deliberate: the rules there were each paid for by a song that got the wrong lyrics, and a
 * second matcher would have to be taught the same lessons one at a time.
