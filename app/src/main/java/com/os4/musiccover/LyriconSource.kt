/**
 * The player's own lyrics, as published by a Lyricon provider - the source that needs no network,
 * no matching and no luck.
 *
 * The two routes this module has had until now both start from the song's name or its id and go
 * looking for a lyric somewhere else, which is why every one of them can fail on a song that
 * plainly has lyrics: the AMLL database is 69,000 songs against everyone's millions, and NetEase
 * has to be asked by name - where the two catalogues disagree on the script of the title, on the
 * length of the master, or on whether the song is there at all.
 *
 * None of that applies to this one. Apple Music fetches syllable-timed TTML for the track it is
 * playing and hands it to its own lyrics view model; a Lyricon provider sits on that and publishes
 * the result. What arrives here is the whole song at once - every line's text, word timings,
 * translation, backing vocal and which side of a duet it is on - for the track the player says it
 * is playing. It is not a guess about a song with the same name; it is that song.
 *
 * It is also entirely optional, and has to behave that way: a device with no Lyricon core service
 * installed gets no callbacks and no error, the subscriber is created once and never touched
 * again, and every entry point here is wrapped, because this runs inside SystemUI.
