     * here, because MIUI is not using that window either. Confirmed on device: the glass
     * refracts a video wallpaper normally.

     *   cropping it would change what the user SEES rather than only its resolution. A hard cut
     *   is the smaller harm.
     * - Take a second run at the same picture. See sLockWpTried.

     *    let alone the system uid SystemUI happens to have. Seen carrying last_type="video" on
     *    the home slot here, which is where the vocabulary is confirmed from.
     * 2. Settings.Secure `flag_lock_wallpaper_type` - lock only, and there is no home
     *    equivalent: `desktop_wallpaper_type` is unset in all three namespaces.
     * 3. Settings.Secure `constant_template_editor_info`, the lock screen editor's JSON, whose
     *    homeInfo/lockscreenInfo both carry a `resourceType`. The only source that covers home.
     *
     * Deliberately NOT WallpaperManager.getWallpaperInfo(FLAG_LOCK): on MIUI every wallpaper,
     * still or video, is drawn by the same com.miui.miwallpaper ImageWallpaper component, so
