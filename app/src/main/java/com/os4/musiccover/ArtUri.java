/**
 * The picture behind a session's artwork URI - the art a player publishes instead of, or before,
 * putting the bitmap into its metadata.
 *
 * Two measured things made this worth having (2026-10-08, MeiloX, com.neoruaa.meilox):
 *
 * SystemUI cannot read a cleartext URL at all. MeiloX publishes http://p1|p2.music.126.net/...
 * and every read of it failed - "Cleartext HTTP traffic to p2.music.126.net not permitted" -
 * 207 attempts in one day's log, not one of them arriving, which also took the whole
 * press-prediction prefetch down with it. The same path over https serves the same picture (200,
 * 776KB for the full one; NetEase's own ?param= takes it to 142KB), so the scheme is rewritten
 * here rather than asking a player to change it.
 *
 * And what we fell back to was worse than no picture. With no bitmap in the session the cover
 * went to the media card's thumbnail, which in that moment is often the card's own empty art:
 * all four pushes taken from a 192x192 thumbnail that day composed to a pure black tint
 * (#ff000000, against real colours on the other thirty-nine), and a later track that read the
 * same stub was dismissed as "same artwork as the last track" and never pushed at all.
 *
 * So: one GET, decoded no larger than the compose ever needs, cached by URL, and asked for in
 * the background so that no caller has to wait on it. Main.albumArt() takes the copy when - and
 * only when - the session has no bitmap of its own, which keeps the rule that a player that does
 * hand over a bitmap never has anything here touch it.
