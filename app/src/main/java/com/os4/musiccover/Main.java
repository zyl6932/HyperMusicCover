     * process in the first place - that the clock's liquid glass and the card blur sample the
     * wallpaper WINDOW, so an in-SystemUI cover is never picked up by them - does not hold
     * here, because MIUI is not using that window either. Confirmed on device: the glass
     * refracts a video wallpaper normally.

     *    let alone the system uid SystemUI happens to have. Seen carrying last_type="video" on
     *    the home slot here, which is where the vocabulary is confirmed from.
     * 2. Settings.Secure `flag_lock_wallpaper_type` - lock only, and there is no home
     *    equivalent: `desktop_wallpaper_type` is unset in all three namespaces.
     * 3. Settings.Secure `constant_template_editor_info`, the lock screen editor's JSON, whose
     *    homeInfo/lockscreenInfo both carry a `resourceType`. The only source that covers home.
     *

     * still or video, is drawn by the same com.miui.miwallpaper ImageWallpaper component, so
     * it answers "live" for all of them and distinguishes nothing.
