/**
 * The cover of the track that has not been asked for yet.
 *
 * Measured on this phone: from a press landing to the player saying a track changed is 713-972ms,
 * and everything the cover does after that is ~110ms. So the swap is not slow - it starts late,
 * and no amount of work on the second number touches the first.
 *
 * A player that publishes a play QUEUE says what is coming before it is asked, which is what this
 * uses: the artwork either side of the current item is fetched and kept, and the press itself -
 * caught on TransportControls, ~0.8s before the player reports anything - hands the right one
 * straight to the wallpaper.
 *
 * Only Apple Music publishes one here. Measured 2026-09-17 with `op queue`: NetEase, Salt Player
 * and Bilibili all answer "no queue", so for them this does nothing at all and the cover waits
 * for the player exactly as it did. Nothing about it is Apple-specific though - the queue and the
 * artwork URI are both public MediaSession API, and any player that fills them in gets it too.
 *
 * Guessing is the whole idea, so being wrong has to be cheap: the prediction is only ever an
 * early push of a picture, and the player's own metadata arrives a moment later and is what
 * settles it. See Main.onMediaUpdate(), which pushes again whenever the two disagree.
