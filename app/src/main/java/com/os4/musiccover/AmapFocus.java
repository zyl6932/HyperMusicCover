/**
 * Lets 高德's ride card be a focus notification at all.
 *
 * The card is posted as 高德 (id 1239; a `param_v2` template now, a `miui.focus.rv` layout of its
 * own when this was written), and the focus plugin threw it away every time:
 *
 *   FocusPlugin: onInflateSuccess 0|com.autonavi.minimap|1239|null|10385
 *   FocusPlugin: onAuthFailed     0|com.autonavi.minimap|1239|null|10385  com.autonavi.minimap
 *   FocusPlugin: removeByKey / removeFocusNotificationByKey / removeIslandDataByKey
 *
 * The way through `FocusNotificationController.fetchAuthResult` (read out of the plugin's smali,
 * classes2.dex) is:
 *
 *   if (!ISLAND_XMS_SWITCHER)                                    -> onAuthSuccess
 *   if (notificationSettingsManager.canPassXMSPermission(pkg))   -> onAuthSuccess
 *   if (IS_INTERNATIONAL_BUILD)                                  -> onAuthSuccess
 *   if (focusNotifUtils.hasCustomFocusView(n)):                  // a miui.focus.rv is one
 *       if (canCustomFocus(pkg) || isNotificationPromotedOngoing) -> onAuthSuccess
 *       resetAllParam(bundle); onAuthFailed(key, pkg)            // <- where 高德 died
 *   if (signatureChecker.checkSignatures(pkg))                   -> onAuthSuccess
 *   AuthManager.auth(context, key, pkg, cb)                      // the cloud service
 *
 * So it is not the cross-package RemoteViews - that only explains `onInflateSuccess` - but
 * `canCustomFocus`, the cloud list of apps allowed a focus view of their own, which does not name
 * 高德. This answers it for that one package and leaves the list alone for everyone else.
 * `canPassXMSPermission` is answered too: it is the earlier door on the same path, and the one
 * that does not depend on which of the two questions a build asks first.
 *
 * Both live on `miui.systemui.notification.NotificationSettingsManager`, which is defined in the
 * control centre plugin's own APK and loaded by a class loader built inside SystemUI long after
 * this module's hooks go in - the same late arrival HyperTweaks watches for. That is what is
 * watched here: every class loader the process builds passes through BaseDexClassLoader's
 * constructor, and the first one that can see the class is the plugin's.
