/**
 * Who the lock screen is given up to, and the one place that gives it.
 *
 * Something drawn behind the whole lock screen - the album cover, an immersive page such as
 * 高德's map - takes the same things from it: the OEM's big clock goes small and up out of the
 * way (ClockCollapse), and the wallpaper's cut-out subject, which the keyguard draws above the
 * clock, goes. Those used to be cover mode's own calls, and every sleep, wake and screen-on path
 * asked "is cover mode on" before touching the clock; a second kind of backdrop had to be taught
 * to each of them (2026-09-29). Now an owner takes the lock screen and gives it back, the clock
 * and the cut-out follow the union of the owners, and the paths that move the clock across a
 * sleep and a wake ask {@link #clockHeld()}.
 *
 * What stays an owner's own is what only it has. The cover fades the media card's thumbnail on
 * the clock's progress and keeps the mini player off screen until its exit has landed; for those
 * the question is whether the clock's flight is the COVER's, which {@link #exitingFor} answers -
 * "the clock is moving" does not say whose it is any more.
