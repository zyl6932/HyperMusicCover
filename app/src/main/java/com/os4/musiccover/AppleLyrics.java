/**
 * Apple Music's own lyrics, taken from inside Apple Music.
 *
 * This is the one player whose words we could never get. It publishes no lyricInfo and no lyric
 * text of any kind - only a numeric store id - so the lock screen has had to ask the AMLL
 * community database for it, and when that misses (which for anything but a well-known track it
 * does) fall through to searching NetEase by name. What Apple has is better than either: word
 * timings for every syllable, the translation, the background vocals, and which voice sings
 * which line.
 *
 * None of it leaves the app on its own. The lyric is built inside the player, for the lyric
 * page, and is never written to the session - so the only way to it is from inside the process,
 * which is why this file exists and why the module's scope now includes com.apple.android.music.
 *
 * The approach - hook the build, and trigger it by handing the player a Song that claims to have
 * lyrics - is Proify and Tomakino's, from LyricProvider's apple-music module (Apache-2.0,
 * github.com/tomakino/LyricProvider). Their reading of Apple's object graph is what this
 * reimplements; the code is ours, because their module is a Lyricon provider built on YukiHookAPI
 * and this one has to be a libxposed hook that answers to our own lock screen.
 *
 * Nothing here talks to SystemUI directly. What it does instead is write the lyric back into
 * Apple Music's own MediaSession, under the "lyricInfo" key the provider modules already use -
 * see {@link LyricSource}. So the lock screen reads it through the route it has read every other
 * player's lyric through, word timings and all, and this file is the only thing that had to be
 * written to make Apple Music work like the rest.
