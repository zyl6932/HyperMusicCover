/**
 * Lyrics for a song nobody published an id for: found by name, fetched from NetEase.
 *
 * This is the last of the three sources and the only one that covers a player which publishes
 * nothing but a title. The other two need something from the session - the player's own
 * lyricInfo, or a MEDIA_ID the AMLL database happens to be keyed by - and measured on this
 * device the two together cover two of the four installed players. NetEase official and Salt
 * publish neither, and no amount of waiting makes an id appear.
 *
 * The reason this is worth a network round trip at all is coverage, and the numbers are not
 * close: AMLL is a community-built set of about 69,000 songs, and both of the first two songs
 * tried against it on this device - neither of them obscure - were 404s. NetEase is the whole
 * catalogue. Its search and lyric endpoints are the ones its old web client used: plain GETs,
 * no signature, no cookie, no account. Measured from this phone, search answers in ~250ms and
 * the lyrics in ~110ms on a reused connection, so ~320ms end to end - faster, as it happens,
 * than the GitHub mirrors the id route races.
 *
 * What it buys with that is a matching problem the id route does not have. An id is exact; a
 * name is not, and the wrong lyrics are worse than none - they scroll, they are confidently
 * mistimed, and there is nothing on screen to say they belong to another song. So the rule
 * here is that a candidate has to be proven, not merely ranked: see pick().
