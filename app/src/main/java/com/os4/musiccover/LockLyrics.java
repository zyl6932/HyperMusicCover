     * on - and 230px of recording is 278px on the screen, which is 557/2, the half card that only
     * a route changing by a whole one can cost. The live card is what is missing for that first
     * second (see card()); which fallback answered instead is what `op lyricstate`'s bandSrc
     * names on the next wake. Reported as "the lyrics hide behind the media card, then jump up".
     *
     * The module has its own lock screen island now and no longer reserves the block for a card
     * that somebody else hid - where the card is taken away the lyrics keep the place they have
     * when it is up, which is also what makes the block hold still across every card appearance

     * The recorded rectangle lags - the card is not sampled while it is hidden or dozing, and
     * onLockTap's notes record a reading of 1360 against a card actually at 1700 - so the route is
     * logged and reported rather than passed off as a measurement.
