 * 高德 17.00.0.2005 on this phone is byte-identical to the ColorOS build apart from its channel
 * id, service included, and the service's side of the protocol has no vendor test in it. What it
 * needs before it can draw is 高德's own navigation page calling
 * NativesModuleImmerseNavi.init() - it does here too (2026-09-29: walking navigation, init with
 * sceneType 4 / pageType 3, the page back in ~190ms). AmapImmerse, in 高德's process, watches that
 * call and the page's destroy and arms and disarms this scene over the SystemUI probe
 * ({@code op immersive --es id amap-nav --es do arm|disarm}).
 *
 * Opened from 高德's focus island - protocol 1, notification id 1236, re-posted every second
 * during the navigation (see the amap-nav-island-focus-notification notes).
