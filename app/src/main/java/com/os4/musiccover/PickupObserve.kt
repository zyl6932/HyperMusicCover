/**
 * How often a parked page is read, out of ColorOS's own file for it
 * (`assets/coloros/pickup-code-observe-config.json`, taken from Gleaner unchanged).
 *
 * These are the numbers this feature used to carry written down by hand, and reading them is worth
 * more than it looks: they are the ones ColorOS tunes per release, and the shape of the choices
 * around them is not the obvious one. The chooser is OPPO's own
 * (`observeagent.impl.pickupcode.c.f`), and it says:
 *
 *   - a ready order is read at [ready], whatever else is true;
 *   - the first two reads after a page is parked are at [firstAfter] - that is what the name means,
 *     not "when the order's state is unknown", which is how this file used to use it;
 *   - after that the order's state decides between [ordered] and [making] (equal in this file);
 *   - a battery under [lowBatteryPercent] raises the interval to [lowBattery] - a floor, not a
 *     switch, so the reads slow down rather than stop, which is what this module used to do;
 *   - and under [skipPercent] the wait is over.
 *
 * A file that cannot be read leaves the defaults, which are the values it ships with.
