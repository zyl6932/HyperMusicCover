/**
 * The back screen's allow-list, and the pickup card's way onto it.
 *
 * `com.xiaomi.subscreencenter` draws a card on the back screen for the packages its own list
 * names - a package and a business together, out of a resource of its own
 * (`<app pkg="..." business="..." group="...">`): 美团 and 淘宝 are `foodDelivery` there, 小爱 is
 * `memory`, and SystemUI is not in it at all. Our pickup notification is posted by SystemUI,
 * because the module lives in that process, so the card reaches the app, is logged, and is
 * dropped before anything is drawn:
 *
 *     postNotification: Package=com.android.systemui, NotificationId=1241, Key=0|com.android.systemui|...
 *     handleNotificationPosted: Package=com.android.systemui, ID=1241
 *     (nothing - no widget for it, while 小爱's own card is built and removed by compositeKey)
 *
 * That list is a compiled resource inside a signed apk, so the only place to say otherwise is in
 * the app's own process: the answer to "may this package draw a widget" is given here, for our
 * package alone.
 *
 * What the app then does with the notification is the pickup card's business, not this file's -
 * `miui.rear.rv` is the card it draws, and [PickupCard] is where the card is built the way a
 * process other than ours can inflate it.
 *
 * The names below are R8's, read off subscreencenter's dex on 2026-10-09 - they move with every
 * release of that app. A lookup that misses costs the card on the back screen and nothing else,
 * which is why each hook is allowed to fail on its own.
