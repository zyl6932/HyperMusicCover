/**
 * The subway commutes the phone has learned, as ColorOS's Metis learns them
 * (CommuteLearningManager: recordTrip, runLearningTask, getMatchRoute), for the ride-code island:
 * a trip that starts where a commute starts, at the time it usually does, is put up at that
 * commute's changes and its end as well as its start - without 高德 navigating it.
 *
 * Metis's rules, kept:
 *   - a trip is its city, first and last station, the stations it changed lines at, and when it
 *     started; one of a single station is not a trip;
 *   - the last 30 days are learned from; a start and end ridden 3 times or more is a commute;
 *   - a change is kept when 20% of those trips made it, and the commute's changes are the most
 *     common sequence of the kept ones;
 *   - when the trips started is kept in 48 half-hour slices;
 *   - a trip is matched by its city and first station: the commute starting there that has trips
 *     in this half hour, the most of them; else the only commute starting there. Only a city's 3
 *     most ridden commutes are looked at (its route list).
 * Not kept: correcting the end over the line graph (Metis has the graph and BLE that misses the
 * last station; the end here is the fare's or 小爱建议's last card), and the fallback by the
 * station next to the start (the graph again).
 *
 * Privacy: what is kept is the names of stations, a city, and start times - no place, no fare,
 * no card. It stays in [file], in 小爱建议's no-backup storage, and is never sent anywhere. Trips
 * older than [KEEP_MS] are dropped on every load and every record, so nothing outlives a month;
 * [forget] drops it all. Nothing is recorded while [learning] is off.
