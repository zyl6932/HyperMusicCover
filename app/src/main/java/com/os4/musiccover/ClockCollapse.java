/**
 * Cover mode's clock: one progress, one owner, one place that writes the views.
 *
 * Two hands move the clock, and they are kept apart.
 *
 * - The OEM's. `notifStateChange(y)` squeezes its variable font - height, width and weight all
 *   follow y down to a floor - and translates its container. y is walked alongside our progress
 *   only so the glyph SHAPE morphs with the motion. Nothing reads the OEM's size or position as
 *   an input to where the clock goes.
 * - Ours. On every pre-draw, after the OEM has written the frame, the clock's live ink box is
 *   read and mapped by one scale and one translation onto the pose this frame should show.
 *   Whatever the OEM did underneath - its squeeze, its growth on a wake, its swap to the AOD
 *   layout, a relayout under a settled clock - is absorbed, because the mapping starts from the
 *   geometry that is about to be drawn, not from a frame ago.
 *
 * A pose is {top of the ink, height of one row of digits, top of the date} in screen pixels. A
 * transition interpolates from the pose on screen when it started to a destination re-derived
 * live every frame; settled, the destination is applied as it is. Every number comes from views,
 * the dp height setting or the date line - nothing depends on the display's resolution.
 *
 * The phases:
 *
 *     OFF    nothing of ours on the clock, no listener
 *     ENTER  springing into the cover look
 *     ON     the cover look, re-applied every frame
 *     EXIT   springing back to the OEM's own pose - out of cover mode, or into the AOD
 *     AOD    cover mode is on but the screen is asleep: the OEM's clock as it is, watched, so the
 *            wake can start from exactly what the AOD was showing
